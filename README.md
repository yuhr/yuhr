- [BlinkDL/RWKV-LM](https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM) - RWKV is an RNN with transformer-level LLM performance. It can be directly trained like a GPT (parallelizable). So it&#39;s combining the best of RNN and transformer - great performance, fast inference, saves VRAM, fast training, &#34;infinite&#34; ctx_len, and free sentence embedding.
